## SDG
**Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages**  
**_Target 3.4: Reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one third by 2030 through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being_**

## Purpose
Provide support to families with aging individuals in physical and mental health aspects.

## Problem statement
According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the proportion of elderly citizens (aged 65 and above) in Malaysia is estimated to increase from 8.1% in 2024 to 14.5% in 2040. This demographic shift indicates an increasing demand for caregivers, especially when their family members struggle to balance work commitments and their responsibility to provide them with continuous physical and emotional support. Therefore, our solution aims to utilise advanced technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) to support the physical and mental well-being of elderly individuals while keeping their family reassured.
